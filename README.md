Most girls have a ton of clothes and yet still don't know what to wear to dinner after work, or that party 
coming up this weekend, or just to office every day. FashWear helps to build stylish outfits from their wardrobe
by building a lookbook from current favourite outfits or taking isnpiration from fashion blag.

App has smarts to suggest outfit ideas based on current weather maybe? (pull from weather API?) and upcoming events 
(outfit photos can be organised by tags then look up by relevant tags e.g. #party #casual) or current trend 
(based on most favourited). These will be automatic notifications that pop up throughout the day.

Allow sharing to social network and favourite friends' outfit.

Note: For some reason the android wear preview app started crashing and notification doesn't work anymore 
so I wasn't able to continue working on it - app is basically non-functional!
