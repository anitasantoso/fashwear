Most girls have tons of clothes in their wardrobe and yet spend a lot of money buying new ones and a lot of time 
figuring out what to wear - weather it be outfit for office everyday, dinner date with girlfriend, or that party coming up this weekend (yes guys will not relate to this!). 

FashWear helps to build stylish outfits from their wardrobe by building personal lookbook from current favourite outfits 
or taking inspiration from fashion blag.

App has smarts to suggest outfit ideas based on current weather maybe? (pull from weather API) and upcoming events 
(outfit photos can be organised by tags then look up by relevant tags e.g. #party #casual) or current trend 
(based on most favourited). These will be automatic notifications that pop up throughout the day.

Allow sharing to social network and favourite friends' outfit.

Note: For some reason the android wear preview app started crashing and notification doesn't work anymore 
so I wasn't able to continue working on it - app is basically non-functional!
